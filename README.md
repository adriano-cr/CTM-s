# CTM-s
Python implementation of the CTM-s model in Python, presented by Ph.D. Carlo Cenedese, prof. Michele Cucuzzella et al. in the paper [A Novel Control-Oriented Cell Transmission Model Including Service Stations on Highways](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15115).    
The program offers a performance oriented functional implementation to run simulations using the equations of the model. It is object oriented and parallelized.   
Included in the setup are the genetic algorithm and neural network portions of code needed for optimizing the position of a service station on a highway stretch with the purpose of minimizing the traffic congestion. These are respectively based on [PyGAD](https://pygad.readthedocs.io/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).  
The project has been created with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), the folder structure may not suit other IDEs.  
  
  
This repository is the result of the master thesis work of **Adriano Cotta Ramusino** and **Davide Spalenza**.
